# Epectation_Maximization_on_GMM
Implementation of Expectation Maximization Algorithm on Gaussian Mixture Models (Three clusters)

Original implementation of the code was done by McDickenson available here - https://github.com/mcdickenson/em-gaussian
considering two gaussian mixture model. This code modified the original work by
extending to three gaussian mixture and shows a way of how to use the same code for n number of 
gaussian mixtures
